AI Usage Documentation

This file explains how I used AI, to help me with troubleshoot some poweshell issues. 

I talked to AI to get help with different problems. Here’s what I did with its help:

Tasks Completed with AI's Assistance

1. Remote Request Execution Service (PowerShell and HTTP)

What I Did: I asked AI to help fix a C# service that runs PowerShell commands (like Get-Mailbox) and HTTP requests. It helped me:

Fix path extraction (e.g., turning "/Get-Mailbox" into "Get-Mailbox").

Add async PowerShell execution with Task.Run.

Create a Dockerfile to run the service in Docker with PowerShell modules.

Troubleshoot errors like "CommandNotFoundException" for Connect-ExchangeOnline.


How It Helped: AI gave me code examples, explained errors, and suggested workarounds (like mocking data when real credentials failed). 

This document is true and shows how AI helped me grow my skills. I’ll update it if I use AI more!
